                Tracking and reporting website traffic is done using Google
                Analytics, a web analytics tool provided by Google. Google
                tracks and keeps track of how our Service is being used. Other
                Google services receive access to this data. Google might
                customise and contextualize the ads on its own advertising
                network using the information gathered. <br />
                By installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, you
                can choose not to allow Google Analytics to collect data about
                your activities on the Service. The add-on stops the Google
                Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) from
                communicating information about visitor activities to Google
                Analytics. <br />
