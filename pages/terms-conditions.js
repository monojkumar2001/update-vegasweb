              <h3 className="pp-sm-title">4. Use of the Services </h3>
              <p className="urbanist-black-16">
              Depending on the size of your account and the number of projects and scopes you have registered for under the relevant plan, you may utilize the Services as needed. While we accept unlimited requests and modifications, the number of work we produce is based on a variety of variables, particularly the volume and complexity of all requests. Although we will try to work with you to meet your deadlines and any priorities, we advise against using our services for urgent tasks.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p className="urbanist-black-16">
              We make every effort to reduce errors. We cannot, however, promise that all files sent will be 100% error-free due to the nature of creative design. When we give a file to you, you promise to check it for any errors or omissions and proof it. You also undertake to let us know right away if any changes or corrections are required. If you let us know about any errors during this time, we'll do our best to expedite updates to fix them. We are not bound to make any corrections if you notify us of any errors after that time, although we do aim to attempt to collaborate with you to do so.

              <p className="urbanist-black-16">
              The quantity of subscriptions you have affects the account's speed. With our staff, our software, and our online platform, we can do what is measured in a subscription as much as we can in a work day. What we may build with a single subscription is influenced by a variety of elements, including but not limited to: (i) the plan type; (ii) the amount of requests; and (iii) the complexity of requests. We can only produce a certain quantity of work with a single subscription, but we cannot promise this. We advise you to upgrade your account with subscriptions to maximize the amount of work we can finish in a business day.
